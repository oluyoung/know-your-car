The main pur- pose of an EDR is to record, in certain crash or near crash-like situations, such as an air bag deployment or hitting a road obstacle, data that will assist in understanding how a vehicle\u2019s systems performed. The EDR is designed to record data related to vehicle dynamics and safety systems for a short period of time, typically 30 seconds or less. The EDR in this vehicle is designed to record such data as: \u2022 How various systems in your vehicle were operating; \u2022 Whether or not the driver and passenger safety belts were buckled/fas-\n\ntened;\n\nHow far (if at all) the driver was depressing the accelerator and/or brake pedal; and,\n\nHow fast the vehicle was traveling.\n\nThese data can help provide a better understanding of the circumstances in which crashes and injuries occur. NOTE: EDR data are recorded by your vehicle only if a non-trivial crash situ- ation occurs; no data are recorded by the EDR under normal driving condi- tions and no personal data (e.g., name, gender, age, and crash location) are recorded. However, other parties, such as law enforcement, could combine the EDR data with the type of personally identifying data routinely acquired during a crash investigation.

Alcohol and certain drugs delay reaction time, impair judgment and reduce coordination, which could lead to an accident that could result in death or serious injury. Defensive driving: Always drive defensively. Anticipate mistakes that other drivers or pedestrians might make and be ready to avoid accidents. Driver distraction: Always give your full attention to driving. Anything that distracts the driver, such as adjusting controls, talking on a cellular phone or reading can result in a collision with resulting death or serious injury to you, your occupants or others.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "83a77014-300f-4f31-b97f-fa0e6eb5e04e": {"__data__": {"id_": "83a77014-300f-4f31-b97f-fa0e6eb5e04e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"year": 2019}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "bec27cb8-11a0-4e00-9232-3cb5d665fe5a", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"year": 2019}, "hash": "aa2055792609883b317a95a3d85ae0926903201a237a8d456d6b708afe8dacd5"}, "2": {"node_id": "94f5b871-c01e-45aa-b52b-4d3d56bafaa9", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"year": 2019}, "hash": "79e6a58190bc1bf1cd36bb26ad1fe4d61f54acb32178bad2745dbdb01a6e13ae"}, "3": {"node_id": "cffc544f-be64-4286-b11f-47466cc87bb0", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"year": 2019}, "hash": "e354e5a158cad4014ac45934c28ca579262cdca001321080275f7d481b185d9d"}}, "hash": "b2d9b21540801912ed0dea4c04c50a8e9e2a2ac8e9489de83eb8fd20b90d773a", "text": "\u25a0 General precaution regarding children\u2019s safety\n\nNever leave children unattended in the vehicle, and never allow children to have or use the key.

Holding a child in your arms is not a substitute for a child restraint system. In an accident, the child can be crushed against the windshield, or between you and the vehicle\u2019s interior. \u25cf Toyota strongly urges the use of a proper child restraint system that con- forms to the size of the child, installed on the rear seat. According to acci- dent statistics, the child is safer when properly restrained in the rear seat than in the front seat.\n\nNever install a rear-facing child restraint system on the front passenger seat even if the \u201cAIR BAG OFF\u201d indicator light is illuminated. In the event of an accident, the force of the rapid inflation of the front pas- senger airbag can cause death or serious injury to the child if the rear-fac- ing child restraint system is installed on the front passenger seat.\n\nA forward-facing child restraint system may be installed on the front pas- senger seat only when it is unavoidable. A child restraint system that requires a top tether strap should not be used in the front passenger seat since there is no top tether strap anchor for the front passenger seat. Adjust the seatback as upright as possible and always move the seat as far back as possible even if the \u201cAIR BAG OFF\u201d indicator light is illumi- nated, because the front passenger airbag could inflate with considerable speed and force. Otherwise, the child may be killed or seriously injured. \u25cf Do not use the seat belt extender when installing a child restraint system on the front or rear passenger seat. If installing a child restraint system with the seat belt extender connected to the seat belt, the seat belt will not securely hold the child restraint system, which could cause death or seri- ous injury to the child or other passengers in the event of a sudden stop, sudden swerve or accident.\n\nDo not allow the child to lean his/her head or any part of his/her body against the door or the area of the seat, front and rear pillars or roof side rails from which the SRS side airbags or SRS curtain shield airbags deploy even if the child is seated in the child restraint system.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "dd63e140-2280-422f-8419-f96f2872c146": {"__data__": {"id_": "dd63e140-2280-422f-8419-f96f2872c146", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"year": 2019}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "bec27cb8-11a0-4e00-9232-3cb5d665fe5a", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"year": 2019}, "hash": "aa2055792609883b317a95a3d85ae0926903201a237a8d456d6b708afe8dacd5"}, "2": {"node_id": "9c0c1c49-0e91-452f-8ff9-8ed9af782051", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"year": 2019}, "hash": "0af2726806ef025036dd7dd3457d9b9f62370156bc41e4883826112f2cf7ec6f"}, "3": {"node_id": "1eea7da4-c5ca-47d7-b478-f2c4618d6a02", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"year": 2019}, "hash": "70ad9f4bcbd8511884c7af7337257b80868e85eeed706652d561bba9800bd70e"}}, "hash": "fbc543cfc447d92afddea3872864e49e2894b8428583aa2cbb41021b061f2a3f", "text": "It is dangerous if the SRS side airbags and curtain shield airbags inflate, and the impact could cause death or serious injury to the child.\n\nMake sure you have complied with all installation instructions provided by the child restraint manufacturer and that the system is properly secured.

If the child restraint system is not correctly fixed in place, the child or other passengers may be seriously injured or even killed in the event of sudden braking, sudden swerving or an accident.\n\nIf the driver\u2019s seat interferes with the child restraint system and prevents it from being attached correctly, attach the child restraint system to the right-hand rear seat.\n\nAdjust the front passenger seat so that it does not interfere with the child restraint system.\n\nOnly put a forward-facing child restraint system on the front seat when unavoid- able. When installing a forward-facing child restraint system on the front pas- senger seat, move the seat as far back as possible even if the \u201cAIR BAG OFF\u201d indicator light is illuminated. Failure to do so may result in death or serious injury if the airbags deploy (inflate).\n\n1-1. For safe use\n\nWARNING\n\n\u25a0 When installing a child restraint system\n\nWhen a booster seat is installed, always ensure that the shoulder belt is positioned across the center of the child\u2019s shoulder. The belt should be kept away from the child\u2019s neck, but not so that it could fall off the child\u2019s shoulder. Failing to do so may result in death or serious injury in the event of sudden braking, sudden swerving or an accident.\n\nEnsure that the belt and plate are securely locked and the seat belt is not twisted.\n\nShake the child restraint system left and right, and forward and backward to ensure that it has been securely installed.\n\nAfter securing a child restraint system, never adjust the seat. \u25cf Follow all installation instructions provided by the child restraint system manufacturer.\n\nWhen securing some types of child restraint systems in rear seats, it may not be possible to properly use the seat belts in positions next to the child restraint without interfering with it or affecting seat belt effectiveness.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2feb197d-94f6-4e78-8d08-9879aa2b6f19": {"__data__": {"id_": "2feb197d-94f6-4e78-8d08-9879aa2b6f19", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"year": 2019}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "bec27cb8-11a0-4e00-9232-3cb5d665fe5a", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"year": 2019}, "hash": "aa2055792609883b317a95a3d85ae0926903201a237a8d456d6b708afe8dacd5"}, "2": {"node_id": "ff4ea6fa-4d40-421f-8aa2-45e96acd203c", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"year": 2019}, "hash": "677386782d79174ef33ac3f41fb5e222516f33fe6c5e743c547b7e6c1bc1df95"}, "3": {"node_id": "4accf499-e104-407e-9fc6-e1cef0deed81", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"year": 2019}, "hash": "abec5c0796649159e9c716f8b045d1722eba0bfad7926624f0752077ea9d4aa3"}}, "hash": "137ec4deb9df5a152b815981a03374dfc6b4342e26873d7908563404ebbf8d9a", "text": "Be sure your seat belt fits snugly across your shoulder and low on your hips.

This lag could cause the driver to down- shift again, causing rapid and excessive engine braking and possibly an accident resulting in death or injury.\n\n\u25a0 Cautions during setting up the display\n\nAs the engine needs to be running during setting up the display, ensure that the vehicle is parked in a place with adequate ventilation. In a closed area such as a garage, exhaust gases including harmful carbon monoxide (CO) may collect and enter the vehicle. This may lead to death or a serious health hazard.\n\nNOTICE\n\n\u25a0 While setting up the display\n\nTo prevent battery discharge, ensure that the engine is running while setting up the display features.\n\n99\n\n2\n\nI n s t r u m e n t\n\nc u s t e r\n\nl\n\n100\n\n2.

Failure to do so may cause an accident resulting in death or serious injury. \u25cf Assisting the driver to measure following distance\n\nThe dynamic radar cruise control with full-speed range is only intended to help the driver in determining the following distance between the driver\u2019s own vehicle and a designated vehicle traveling ahead. It is not a mecha- nism that allows careless or inattentive driving, and it is not a system that can assist the driver in low-visibility conditions. It is still necessary for driver to pay close attention to the vehicle\u2019s surroundings.\n\nAssisting the driver to judge proper following distance\n\nThe dynamic radar cruise control with full-speed range determines whether the following distance between the driver\u2019s own vehicle and a designated vehicle traveling ahead is within a set range. It is not capable of making any other type of judgement. Therefore, it is absolutely neces- sary for the driver to remain vigilant and to determine whether or not there is a possibility of danger in any given situation.\n\nAssisting the driver to operate the vehicle\n\nThe dynamic radar cruise control with full-speed range has limited capabil- ity to prevent or avoid a collision with a vehicle traveling ahead. Therefore, if there is ever any danger, the driver must take immediate and direct con- trol of the vehicle and act appropriately in order to ensure the safety of all involved.\n\n239\n\n4\n\nD\n\nr i v n g\n\ni\n\n240\n\n4-5.

If a sensor or its surrounding area on the rear bumper is dirty or covered with snow, the Blind Spot Monitor may not operate and a warning message will be displayed. (\uf0aeP. 252) In this situation, clear off the dirt or snow and drive the vehicle with the operation conditions of the BSM func- tion satisfied for approximately 60 min- utes. If the warning message does not disappear, have the vehicle inspected by your Toyota dealer\n\nDo not subject a sensor or its surrounding area on the rear bumper to a strong impact. If a sensor is moved even slightly off position, the system may malfunction and vehicles may not be detected correctly. In the following situations, have your vehicle inspected by your Toyota dealer. \u2022 A sensor or its surrounding area is subject to a strong impact. \u2022 If the surrounding area of a sensor is scratched or dented, or part of\n\nthem has become disconnected.\n\nDo not disassemble the sensor. \u25cf Do not attach accessories or stickers to the sensor or surrounding area on the bumper.\n\nDo not modify the sensor or surrounding area on the bumper. \u25cf Do not paint the rear bumper any color other than an official Toyota color.\n\n4-5.

Other interior features\n\nSafety Connect services\n\n\u25a0 Automatic Collision Notification\n\nIn case of either airbag deployment or severe rear-end collision, the system is designed to automatically call the response center. The responding agent receives the vehicle\u2019s location and attempts to speak with the vehicle occupants to assess the level of emergency. If the occupants are unable to communicate, the agent automati- cally treats the call as an emergency, contacts the nearest emer- gency services provider to describe the situation, and requests that assistance be sent to the location.\n\n\u25a0 Stolen Vehicle Location\n\nIf your vehicle is stolen, Safety Connect can work with local author- ities to assist them in locating and recovering the vehicle. After filing a police report, call the Safety Connect response center at 1-855- 405-6500 in the Unites States, 1-877-855-8377 in Puerto Rico or 1- 888-869-6828 in Canada, and follow the prompts for Safety Con- nect to initiate this service. In addition to assisting law enforcement with recovery of a stolen vehicle, Safety-Connect-equipped vehicle location data may, under certain circumstances, be shared with third parties to locate your vehicle.

Read this information before using Safety Connect. \u25a0 Exposure to radio frequency signals\n\nThe Safety Connect system installed in your vehicle is a low-power radio transmitter and receiver. It receives and also sends out radio frequency (RF) signals.\n\nIn August 1996, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) adopted RF exposure guidelines with safety levels for mobile wire- less phones. Those guidelines are consistent with the safety stan- dards previously set by the following U.S. and international standards bodies. \u25cf ANSI (American National Standards Institute) C95.1 [1992] \u25cf NCRP (National Council on Radiation Protection and Measure-\n\nment) Report 86 [1986]\n\nICNIRP (International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection) [1996]\n\nThose standards were based on comprehensive and periodic eval- uations of the relevant scientific literature. Over 120 scientists, engi- neers, and physicians from universities, and government health agencies and industries reviewed the available body of research to develop the ANSI Standard (C95.1).\n\nThe design of Safety Connect complies with the FCC guidelines in addition to those standards.\n\n\u25a0 Certification for Safety Connect\n\nFCC ID: LHJ-TVN IC: 2807E-TVN\n\n5-4.

To avoid death or serious injury, observe the following precautions. \u25a0 When working on the engine compartment\n\nKeep hands, clothing and tools away from the moving fan and engine drive belt.\n\nBe careful not to touch the engine, radiator, exhaust manifold, etc. right after driving as they may be hot. Oil and other fluids may also be hot.\n\nDo not leave anything that may burn easily, such as paper and rags, in the engine compartment.\n\nDo not smoke, cause sparks or expose an open flame to fuel or the bat- tery. Fuel and battery fumes are flammable.\n\nBe extremely cautious when working on the battery. It contains poisonous and corrosive sulfuric acid.\n\n\u25a0 When working near the electric cooling fan or radiator grille\n\nBe sure the engine switch is off. With the engine switch in IGNITION ON mode, the electric cooling fan may automatically start to run if the air condi- tioning is on and/or the coolant temperature is high. (\uf0aeP. 382)\n\n\u25a0 Safety glasses\n\nWear safety glasses to prevent flying or falling material, fluid spray, etc. from getting in your eyes.\n\nNOTICE\n\n\u25a0 If you remove the air cleaner filter\n\nDriving with the air cleaner filter removed may cause excessive engine wear due to dirt in the air.\n\n6-3.

In this case, after driving for about 20 minutes, the tire pressure warning light will blink for approximately 1 minute and then illuminate to indicate a system malfunction.\n\n\u25a0 Tire life\n\nAny tire over 6 years old must be checked by a qualified technician even if it has seldom or never been used or damage is not obvious.\n\n\u25a0 Routine tire inflation pressure checks\n\nThe tire pressure warning system does not replace routine tire inflation pressure checks. Make sure to check tire inflation pressure as part of your routine of daily vehicle checks.\n\n\u25a0 Low profile tires (vehicles with 18 or 19-inch wheels)\n\nGenerally, low profile tires will wear more rapidly and tire grip perfor- mance will be reduced on snowy and/or icy roads when compared to standard tires.

Do-it-yourself maintenance\n\n\u25a0 Tire types\n\nSummer tires\n\nSummer tires are high-speed performance tires best suited to highway driving under dry conditions. Since summer tires do not have the same traction performance as snow tires, summer tires are inadequate for driving on snow-covered or icy roads. For driving on snow-covered roads or icy roads, the use of snow tires is recommended. When install- ing snow tires, be sure to replace all four tires.\n\nAll season tires\n\nAll season tires are designed to provide better traction in snow and to be adequate for driving in most winter conditions as well as for use year-round. All season tires, however, do not have adequate traction performance compared with snow tires in heavy or loose snow. Also, all season tires fall short in acceleration and handling performance com- pared with summer tires in highway driving.\n\nSnow tires\n\nFor driving on snow-covered roads or icy roads, we recommend using snow tires. If you need snow tires, select tires of the same size, con- struction and load capacity as the originally installed tires. Since your vehicle has radial tires as original equipment, make sure your snow tires also have radial construction. Do not install studded tires without first checking local regulations for possible restrictions. Snow tires should be installed on all wheels.

Steps to take in an emergency\n\nWARNING\n\n\u25a0 Maintenance of the tires\n\nEach tire, including the spare (if provided), should be checked monthly when cold and inflated to the inflation pressure recommended by the vehicle manufacturer on the vehicle placard or tire inflation pressure label (tire and load information label). (If your vehicle has tires of a dif- ferent size than the size indicated on the vehicle placard or tire inflation pressure label [tire and load information label], you should determine the proper tire inflation pressure for those tires.) As an added safety feature, your vehicle has been equipped with a tire pressure monitoring system (TPMS-tire pressure warning system) that illuminates a low tire pressure telltale (tire pressure warning light) when one or more of your tires is significantly under-inflated. Accordingly, when the low tire pressure telltale (tire pressure warning light) illumi- nates, you should stop and check your tires as soon as possible, and inflate them to the proper pressure. Driving on a significantly under- inflated tire causes the tire to overheat and can lead to tire failure. Under-inflation also reduces fuel efficiency and tire tread life, and may affect the vehicle\u2019s handling and stopping ability. Please note that the TPMS (tire pressure warning system) is not a sub- stitute for proper tire maintenance, and it is the driver\u2019s responsibility to maintain correct tire pressure, even if under-inflation has not reached the level to trigger illumination of the TPMS low tire pressure telltale (tire pressure warning light). Your vehicle has also been equipped with a TPMS (tire pressure warn- ing system) malfunction indicator to indicate when the system is not operating properly. The TPMS (tire pressure warning system) malfunc- tion indicator is combined with the low tire pressure telltale (tire pressure warning light).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a968820f-0013-4e30-8124-fe5ff6c94cdb": {"__data__": {"id_": "a968820f-0013-4e30-8124-fe5ff6c94cdb", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"year": 2019}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "bec27cb8-11a0-4e00-9232-3cb5d665fe5a", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"year": 2019}, "hash": "aa2055792609883b317a95a3d85ae0926903201a237a8d456d6b708afe8dacd5"}, "2": {"node_id": "4d30394b-f249-4cdb-81ae-79a9e83ec46e", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"year": 2019}, "hash": "5db704ab2c4e64ee816cde7736d88206619c9e3c8f793f380b531e69172b6355"}, "3": {"node_id": "d3152bd0-44a3-416b-9a71-2f49fdfccc95", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"year": 2019}, "hash": "53c808f8e79ca27ce023e5403916fdbecc0ad39517daaf767ecdd9ca689880ac"}}, "hash": "9f1775a565cbf36c4d0ec6b00c05a2d4759b870cfb010d3427cfc730f2f54986", "text": "When the system detects a malfunction, the telltale will flash for approximately one minute and then remain continuously illumi- nated.

These fuels are typically acceptable for use, providing they meet other fuel requirements. Toyota recommends these fuels, since the formulations allow for reduced vehicle emissions.\n\n\u25a0 Non-recommendation of the use of blended gasoline\n\nUse only gasoline containing up to 15% ethanol. DO NOT use any flex-fuel or gasoline that could contain more than 15% etha- nol, including from any pump labeled E30, E50, E85 (which are only some examples of fuel containing more than 15% ethanol).\n\nDO NOT use gasoline contain- ing more than 15% ethanol.\n\n(30% ethanol)\n\n(50% ethanol)\n\n(85% ethanol)\n\nIf you use gasohol in your vehicle, be sure that it has an octane rating no lower than 87.\n\nToyota does not recommend the use of gasoline containing methanol.\n\n\u25a0 Non-recommendation of the use of gasoline containing MMT\n\nSome gasoline contains an octane enhancing additive called MMT (Methylcy- clopentadienyl Manganese Tricarbonyl). Toyota does not recommend the use of gasoline that contains MMT. If fuel containing MMT is used, your emission control system may be adversely affected. The malfunction indicator lamp on the instrument cluster may come on.
