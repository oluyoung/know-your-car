The main pur- pose of an EDR is to record, in certain crash or near crash-like situations, such as an air bag deployment or hitting a road obstacle, data that will assist in understanding how a vehicle\u2019s systems performed. The EDR is designed to record data related to vehicle dynamics and safety systems for a short period of time, typically 30 seconds or less. The EDR in this vehicle is designed to record such data as: \u2022 How various systems in your vehicle were operating; \u2022 Whether or not the driver and passenger safety belts were buckled/fas-\n\ntened;\n\nHow far (if at all) the driver was depressing the accelerator and/or brake pedal; and,\n\nHow fast the vehicle was traveling.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "498ed704-b53c-402a-8c6e-6b893a98dd66": {"__data__": {"id_": "498ed704-b53c-402a-8c6e-6b893a98dd66", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"year": 2021}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "2f052a6f-ca2c-4d02-a190-afb23ac726e8", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"year": 2021}, "hash": "dcbdece47b1b641c5b6865b3914c32c032a049703ae56daee296cd89577af5e0"}, "2": {"node_id": "007c4b25-b8af-48d8-84ff-bf7c7a880f2a", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"year": 2021}, "hash": "7a4f68ba4e7f0e431ece1c11b23c6bd03bd632efb57a73f2b1738642e0eabe61"}, "3": {"node_id": "359c088d-2461-474a-80fa-d2f6fa161ec9", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"year": 2021}, "hash": "572c71b78ab0402f97aeeeb1589f0a695ec1050465290becb72669f6bc80a261"}}, "hash": "ca3b88ccb5d3126dd1e4e5607e1ffe461ff3e8d4f6cb47fcfe08e82306983734", "text": "These data can help provide a better understanding of the circumstances in which crashes and injuries occur. NOTE: EDR data are recorded by your vehicle only if a non-trivial crash situ- ation occurs; no data are recorded by the EDR under normal driving condi- tions and no personal data (e.g., name, gender, age, and crash location) are recorded. However, other parties, such as law enforcement, could combine the EDR data with the type of personally identifying data routinely acquired during a crash investigation. To read data recorded by an EDR, special equipment is required, and access to the vehicle or the EDR is needed. In addition to the vehicle manufacturer, other parties, such as law enforcement, that have the special equipment, can read the information if they have access to the vehicle or the EDR. \u25cf Disclosure of the EDR data\n\nToyota will not disclose the data recorded in an EDR to a third party except when: \u2022 An agreement from the vehicle\u2019s owner (or the lessee for a leased vehi-\n\ncle) is obtained\n\nIn response to an official request by the police, a court of law or a govern- ment agency\n\nFor use by Toyota in a lawsuit However, if necessary, Toyota may: \u2022 Use the data for research on vehicle safety performance \u2022 Disclose the data to a third party for research purposes without disclosing information about the specific vehicle or vehicle owner\n\n11\n\n12\n\nScrapping of your Toyota\n\nThe SRS airbag and seat belt pretensioner devices in your Toyota contain explosive chemicals. If the vehicle is scrapped with the airbags and seat belt pretensioners left as they are, this may cause an accident such as fire. Be sure to have the systems of the SRS airbag and seat belt pretensioner removed and disposed of by a qualified service shop or by your Toyota dealer before you scrap your vehicle.\n\nPerchlorate Material\n\nSpecial handling may apply, See www.dtsc.ca.gov/hazardouswaste/perchlorate. Your vehicle has components that may contain perchlorate. These compo- nents may include airbag, seat belt pretensioners, and wireless remote con- trol batteries.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "359c088d-2461-474a-80fa-d2f6fa161ec9": {"__data__": {"id_": "359c088d-2461-474a-80fa-d2f6fa161ec9", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"year": 2021}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "2f052a6f-ca2c-4d02-a190-afb23ac726e8", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"year": 2021}, "hash": "dcbdece47b1b641c5b6865b3914c32c032a049703ae56daee296cd89577af5e0"}, "2": {"node_id": "498ed704-b53c-402a-8c6e-6b893a98dd66", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"year": 2021}, "hash": "ca3b88ccb5d3126dd1e4e5607e1ffe461ff3e8d4f6cb47fcfe08e82306983734"}, "3": {"node_id": "de45a579-3395-477b-90f0-a74c7f5601ef", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"year": 2021}, "hash": "de012a157e41b50984b69284018e75f6dc48caa2fbd615318ccf903581f257de"}}, "hash": "572c71b78ab0402f97aeeeb1589f0a695ec1050465290becb72669f6bc80a261", "text": "WARNING\n\n\u25a0 General precautions while driving\n\nDriving under the influence: Never drive your vehicle when under the influ- ence of alcohol or drugs that have impaired your ability to operate your vehi- cle. Alcohol and certain drugs delay reaction time, impair judgment and reduce coordination, which could lead to an accident that could result in death or serious injury. Defensive driving: Always drive defensively. Anticipate mistakes that other drivers or pedestrians might make and be ready to avoid accidents. Driver distraction: Always give your full attention to driving. Anything that distracts the driver, such as adjusting controls, talking on a cellular phone or reading can result in a collision with resulting death or serious injury to you, your occupants or others.\n\n\u25a0 General precaution regarding children\u2019s safety\n\nNever leave children unattended in the vehicle, and never allow children to have or use the key. Children may be able to start the vehicle or shift the vehicle into neutral. There is also a danger that children may injure themselves by playing with the windows, the moon roof, or other features of the vehicle. In addition, heat build-up or extremely cold temperatures inside the vehicle can be fatal to children.\n\n13\n\n14\n\nReading this manual\n\nWARNING: Explains something that, if not obeyed, could cause death or serious injury to people.\n\nNOTICE: Explains something that, if not obeyed, could cause damage to or a malfunction in the vehicle or its equipment.\n\n1 2 3\n\nIndicates operating or working procedures.

For safe use\n\nWARNING\n\n\u25a0 SRS airbag precautions\n\nObserve the following precautions regarding the SRS airbags. Failure to do so may cause death or serious injury. \u25cf The driver and all passengers in the vehicle must wear their seat belts\n\nproperly. The SRS airbags are supplemental devices to be used with the seat belts. \u25cf The SRS driver airbag deploys with considerable force, and can cause death or serious injury especially if the driver is very close to the airbag. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) advises: Since the risk zone for the driver\u2019s airbag is the first 2 - 3 in. (50 - 75 mm) of inflation, placing yourself 10 in. (250 mm) from your driver airbag pro- vides you with a clear margin of safety. This distance is measured from the center of the steering wheel to your breastbone. If you sit less than 10 in. (250 mm) away now, you can change your driving position in several ways: \u2022 Move your seat to the rear as far as you can while still reaching the ped-\n\nals comfortably.\n\nSlightly recline the back of the seat.\n\nAlthough vehicle designs vary, many drivers can achieve the 10 in. (250 mm) distance, even with the driver seat all the way forward, simply by reclining the back of the seat somewhat. If reclining the back of your seat makes it hard to see the road, raise yourself by using a firm, non- slippery cushion, or raise the seat if your vehicle has that feature.\n\nIf your steering wheel is adjustable, tilt it downward. This points the air- bag toward your chest instead of your head and neck.\n\nThe seat should be adjusted as recommended by NHTSA above, while still maintaining control of the foot pedals, steering wheel, and your view of the instrument panel controls.\n\n39\n\n1\n\nF o r\n\ns a f e t y\n\na n d\n\ns e c u r i t y\n\n40\n\n1-1.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3dead92a-2c73-4759-9dc7-9c957f639fca": {"__data__": {"id_": "3dead92a-2c73-4759-9dc7-9c957f639fca", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"year": 2021}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "2f052a6f-ca2c-4d02-a190-afb23ac726e8", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"year": 2021}, "hash": "dcbdece47b1b641c5b6865b3914c32c032a049703ae56daee296cd89577af5e0"}, "2": {"node_id": "a98022fd-ea0a-4971-9c17-25239f828756", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"year": 2021}, "hash": "d493ed191486af6f6afbf25fc35e7374e0cb912c25168084811f0231cdf964f7"}, "3": {"node_id": "4eeb70ec-c02f-4bcc-bf3c-1b61010fcdf7", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"year": 2021}, "hash": "661b68851b7c1ce774b744aff80bd5e3931c98abc1eb036e9da330f562bdcdaf"}}, "hash": "8787c5f64fb8692c319608eb4263b8802d3b0ed8182aab7ae8e8f0626423573f", "text": "For safe use\n\nWARNING\n\n\u25a0 SRS airbag precautions\n\nIf the seat belt extender has been con- nected to the driver\u2019s seat belt buckle but the seat belt extender has not also been fastened to the latch plate of the driver\u2019s seat belt, the SRS front airbags for the driver will judge that the driver is wearing the seat belt even though the seat belt has not been connected. In this case, the SRS front airbags for the driver may not activate correctly in a collision, resulting in death or serious injury in the event of a collision. Be sure to wear the seat belt with the seat belt extender.\n\nThe SRS front passenger airbag also deploys with considerable force, and can cause death or serious injury especially if the front passenger is very close to the airbag. The front passenger seat should be as far from the air- bag as possible with the seatback adjusted, so the front passenger sits upright.\n\nImproperly seated and/or restrained infants and children can be killed or seriously injured by a deploying airbag. An infant or child who is too small to use a seat belt should be properly secured using a child restraint sys- tem.

Holding a child in your arms is not a substitute for a child restraint system. In an accident, the child can be crushed against the windshield, or between you and the vehicle\u2019s interior. \u25cf Toyota strongly urges the use of a proper child restraint system that con- forms to the size of the child, installed on the rear seat. According to acci- dent statistics, the child is safer when properly restrained in the rear seat than in the front seat.\n\nNever install a rear-facing child restraint system on the front passenger seat even if the \u201cAIR BAG OFF\u201d indicator light is illuminated. In the event of an accident, the force of the rapid inflation of the front pas- senger airbag can cause death or serious injury to the child if the rear-fac- ing child restraint system is installed on the front passenger seat.\n\nA forward-facing child restraint system may be installed on the front pas- senger seat only when it is unavoidable. A child restraint system that requires a top tether strap should not be used in the front passenger seat since there is no top tether strap anchor for the front passenger seat. Adjust the seatback as upright as possible and always move the seat as far back as possible even if the \u201cAIR BAG OFF\u201d indicator light is illumi- nated, because the front passenger airbag could inflate with considerable speed and force. Otherwise, the child may be killed or seriously injured. \u25cf Do not use the seat belt extender when installing a child restraint system on the front or rear passenger seat. If installing a child restraint system with the seat belt extender connected to the seat belt, the seat belt will not securely hold the child restraint system, which could cause death or seri- ous injury to the child or other passengers in the event of a sudden stop, sudden swerve or accident.\n\nDo not allow the child to lean his/her head or any part of his/her body against the door or the area of the seat, front and rear pillars or roof side rails from which the SRS side airbags or SRS curtain shield airbags deploy even if the child is seated in the child restraint system.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "40773658-29d8-431b-b47c-3c0c9730c59a": {"__data__": {"id_": "40773658-29d8-431b-b47c-3c0c9730c59a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"year": 2021}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "2f052a6f-ca2c-4d02-a190-afb23ac726e8", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"year": 2021}, "hash": "dcbdece47b1b641c5b6865b3914c32c032a049703ae56daee296cd89577af5e0"}, "2": {"node_id": "92a75cff-a7a9-491f-a5db-55ecf1bc9ed8", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"year": 2021}, "hash": "8a1d3d1a8f5c8067acf93ddba651789ef8ed0cbe35cc2e2c9df2d78aac9e758f"}, "3": {"node_id": "c17ce97e-92c2-4b6f-b853-5d7d5156f617", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"year": 2021}, "hash": "0acad987ff4f8cf340d9bd43dc2cca73afaf65ed1aede123aa922f1b93e22f98"}}, "hash": "199b5d356f4f1482a81802b39aec635592c887e721cf64dab063d08aeb2010b5", "text": "It is dangerous if the SRS side airbags and curtain shield airbags inflate, and the impact could cause death or serious injury to the child.\n\nMake sure you have complied with all installation instructions provided by the child restraint manufacturer and that the system is properly secured.

The responding agent receives the vehicle\u2019s location and attempts to speak with the vehicle occupants to assess the level of emergency. If the occupants are unable to communicate, the agent automati- cally treats the call as an emergency, contacts the nearest emer- gency services provider to describe the situation, and requests that assistance be sent to the location.\n\n\u25a0 Stolen Vehicle Location\n\nIf your vehicle is stolen, Safety Connect can work with local author- ities to assist them in locating and recovering the vehicle. After filing a police report, call the Customer Experience Center at 1-800-331- 4331 in the United States, 1-877-855-8377 in Puerto Rico or 1-888- 869-6828 in Canada, and follow the prompts for Safety Connect to initiate this service. In addition to assisting law enforcement with recovery of a stolen vehicle, Safety-Connect-equipped vehicle location data may, under certain circumstances, be shared with third parties to locate your vehicle.

It receives and also sends out radio frequency (RF) signals.\n\nIn August 1996, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) adopted RF exposure guidelines with safety levels for mobile wire- less phones. Those guidelines are consistent with the safety stan- dards previously set by the following U.S. and international standards bodies. \u25cf ANSI (American National Standards Institute) C95.1 [1992] \u25cf NCRP (National Council on Radiation Protection and Measure-\n\nment) Report 86 [1986]\n\nICNIRP (International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection) [1996]\n\nThose standards were based on comprehensive and periodic eval- uations of the relevant scientific literature. Over 120 scientists, engi- neers, and physicians from universities, and government health agencies and industries reviewed the available body of research to develop the ANSI Standard (C95.1).\n\nThe design of Safety Connect complies with the FCC guidelines in addition to those standards.\n\n75\n\n1\n\nF o r\n\ns a f e t y\n\na n d\n\ns e c u r i t y\n\n76\n\n1-2.

At extremely low temperatures, the information display monitor may respond slowly, and display changes may be delayed. For example, there is a lag between the driver\u2019s shifting and the new gear number appearing on the display. This lag could cause the driver to down- shift again, causing rapid and excessive engine braking and possibly an accident resulting in death or injury.\n\n\u25a0 Cautions during setting up the display\n\nAs the engine needs to be running during setting up the display, ensure that the vehicle is parked in a place with adequate ventilation. In a closed area such as a garage, exhaust gases including harmful carbon monoxide (CO) may collect and enter the vehicle.

Using the driving support systems\n\nWARNING\n\n\u25a0 Before using dynamic radar cruise control with full-speed range\n\nDriving safely is the sole responsibility of the driver. Do not rely solely on the system, and drive safely by always paying careful attention to your sur- roundings.\n\nThe dynamic radar cruise control with full-speed range provides driving assistance to reduce the driver's burden. However, there are limitations to the assistance provided. Read the following conditions carefully. Do not overly rely on this system and always drive carefully. \u2022 When the sensor may not be correctly detecting the vehicle ahead: \uf0aeP. 258\n\nConditions under which the vehicle-to-vehicle distance control mode may not function correctly: \uf0aeP. 259\n\nSet the speed appropriately depending on the speed limit, traffic flow, road conditions, weather conditions, etc. The driver is responsible for checking the set speed.\n\nEven when the system is functioning normally, the condition of the preced- ing vehicle as detected by the system may differ from the condition observed by the driver. Therefore, the driver must always remain alert, assess the danger of each situation and drive safely. Relying on this sys- tem or assuming the system ensures safety while driving can lead to an accident, resulting in death or serious injury.\n\nSwitch the dynamic radar cruise control with full-speed range off using the\n\ncruise control main switch when not in use. \u25a0 Cautions regarding the driving assist systems\n\nObserve the following precautions, as there are limitations to the assistance provided by the system.

It is not a mecha- nism that allows careless or inattentive driving, and it is not a system that can assist the driver in low-visibility conditions. It is still necessary for driver to pay close attention to the vehicle\u2019s surroundings.\n\nAssisting the driver to judge proper following distance\n\nThe dynamic radar cruise control with full-speed range determines whether the following distance between the driver\u2019s own vehicle and a designated vehicle traveling ahead is within a set range. It is not capable of making any other type of judgement. Therefore, it is absolutely neces- sary for the driver to remain vigilant and to determine whether or not there is a possibility of danger in any given situation.\n\n4-5. Using the driving support systems\n\nWARNING\n\nAssisting the driver to operate the vehicle\n\nThe dynamic radar cruise control with full-speed range has limited capabil- ity to prevent or avoid a collision with a vehicle traveling ahead.

Using the driving support systems\n\nDriving in vehicle-to-vehicle distance control mode\n\nThis mode employs a radar sensor to detect the presence of vehicles up to approximately 328 ft. (100 m) ahead, determines the current vehicle-to-vehicle following distance, and operates to maintain a suit- able following distance from the vehicle ahead.\n\nNote that vehicle-to-vehicle distance will close in when traveling on down- hill slopes.\n\n1\n\nExample of constant speed cruising When there are no vehicles ahead\n\n2\n\nThe vehicle travels at the speed set by the driver. The desired vehicle-to- vehicle distance can also be set by operating the vehicle-to-vehicle dis- tance switch. Example of deceleration cruising and follow-up cruising When a preceding vehicle driving slower than the set speed appears\n\nWhen a vehicle is detected running ahead of you, the system automatically decelerates your vehicle. When a greater reduction in vehicle speed is necessary, the system applies the brakes (the stop lights will come on at this time). The system will respond to changes in the speed of the vehicle ahead in order to maintain the vehicle-to-vehicle distance set by the driver. Approach warning warns you when the system cannot decelerate suffi- ciently to prevent your vehicle from closing in on the vehicle ahead. When the vehicle ahead of you stops, your vehicle will also stop (vehicle is stopped by system control). After the vehicle ahead starts off, pressing the \u201c+ RES\u201d switch or depressing the accelerator pedal will resume follow-up cruising.\n\n4-5.

Always drive safely, taking care to observe your surroundings. The BSM function is a supplementary function which alerts the driver that a vehicle is present in the blind spot. Do not overly rely on the BSM function. The function cannot judge if it is safe to change lanes, therefore over reli- ance could cause an accident resulting in death or serious injury.

Do-it-yourself maintenance\n\n\u25a0 Tire types\n\nSummer tires\n\nSummer tires are high-speed performance tires best suited to highway driving under dry conditions. Since summer tires do not have the same traction performance as snow tires, summer tires are inadequate for driving on snow-covered or icy roads. For driving on snow-covered roads or icy roads, the use of snow tires is recommended. When install- ing snow tires, be sure to replace all four tires.\n\nAll season tires\n\nAll season tires are designed to provide better traction in snow and to be adequate for driving in most winter conditions as well as for use year-round. All season tires, however, do not have adequate traction performance compared with snow tires in heavy or loose snow. Also, all season tires fall short in acceleration and handling performance com- pared with summer tires in highway driving.\n\nSnow tires\n\nFor driving on snow-covered roads or icy roads, we recommend using snow tires. If you need snow tires, select tires of the same size, con- struction and load capacity as the originally installed tires. Since your vehicle has radial tires as original equipment, make sure your snow tires also have radial construction. Do not install studded tires without first checking local regulations for possible restrictions. Snow tires should be installed on all wheels.

Do-it-yourself maintenance\n\nWARNING\n\n\u25a0 When replacing wheels\n\nDo not use wheels that are a different size from those recommended in the Owner\u2019s Manual, as this may result in a loss of handling control. \u25cf Never use an inner tube in a leaking wheel which is designed for a tubeless tire. Doing so may result in an accident, causing death or seri- ous injury.\n\n\u25a0 When installing the wheel nuts\n\nBe sure to install the wheel nuts with the tapered ends facing inward. (\uf0aeP. 457) Installing the nuts with the tapered ends facing outward can cause the wheel to break and eventually cause the wheel to come off while driving, which could lead to an accident resulting in death or seri- ous injury.\n\nNever use oil or grease on the wheel bolts or wheel nuts.\n\nOil and grease may cause the wheel nuts to be excessively tightened, leading to bolt or disc wheel damage. In addition, the oil or grease can cause the wheel nuts to loosen and the wheel may fall off, causing an accident and resulting in death or serious injury. Remove any oil or grease from the wheel bolts or wheel nuts.\n\nNOTICE\n\n\u25a0 Replacing tire pressure warning valve and transmitters\n\nBecause tire repair or replacement may affect the tire pressure warn- ing valve and transmitters, make sure to have tires serviced by your Toyota dealer or other qualified service shop. In addition, make sure to purchase your tire pressure warning valve and transmitters at your Toyota dealer.\n\nEnsure that only genuine Toyota wheels are used on your vehicle. Tire pressure warning valve and transmitters may not work properly with non-genuine wheels.\n\n6-3.

(If your vehicle has tires of a dif- ferent size than the size indicated on the vehicle placard or tire inflation pressure label [tire and load information label], you should determine the proper tire inflation pressure for those tires.) As an added safety feature, your vehicle has been equipped with a tire pressure monitoring system (TPMS-tire pressure warning system) that illuminates a low tire pressure telltale (tire pressure warning light) when one or more of your tires is significantly under-inflated. Accordingly, when the low tire pressure telltale (tire pressure warning light) illumi- nates, you should stop and check your tires as soon as possible, and inflate them to the proper pressure. Driving on a significantly under- inflated tire causes the tire to overheat and can lead to tire failure. Under-inflation also reduces fuel efficiency and tire tread life, and may affect the vehicle\u2019s handling and stopping ability. Please note that the TPMS (tire pressure warning system) is not a sub- stitute for proper tire maintenance, and it is the driver\u2019s responsibility to maintain correct tire pressure, even if under-inflation has not reached the level to trigger illumination of the TPMS low tire pressure telltale (tire pressure warning light). Your vehicle has also been equipped with a TPMS (tire pressure warn- ing system) malfunction indicator to indicate when the system is not operating properly. The TPMS (tire pressure warning system) malfunc- tion indicator is combined with the low tire pressure telltale (tire pressure warning light). When the system detects a malfunction, the telltale will flash for approximately one minute and then remain continuously illumi- nated. This sequence will continue upon subsequent vehicle start-ups as long as the malfunction exists. When the malfunction indicator is illu- minated, the system may not be able to detect or signal low tire pres- sure as intended.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d21e6fa0-e04b-4ce1-bab5-4379e9c00832": {"__data__": {"id_": "d21e6fa0-e04b-4ce1-bab5-4379e9c00832", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"year": 2021}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "2f052a6f-ca2c-4d02-a190-afb23ac726e8", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"year": 2021}, "hash": "dcbdece47b1b641c5b6865b3914c32c032a049703ae56daee296cd89577af5e0"}, "2": {"node_id": "fc575be2-f358-4d34-863e-531c4bdf2000", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"year": 2021}, "hash": "22ff6c4ffe583d4327f6dce525cd3d5d4eb1b259b9b1bbb8b966c87e41c47261"}, "3": {"node_id": "f1e51d7a-a929-4aa2-add1-060a398be2ea", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"year": 2021}, "hash": "b290b9bd3a035dae9e7777c8d126fb77ed893419d32eefbdfe44ff2051b52770"}}, "hash": "645816a427a1cfe7a29a3dc3f8a3db997def0da5e4d93aac34a1c9f0833b9719", "text": "TPMS (tire pressure warning system) malfunctions may occur for a vari- ety of reasons, including the installation of replacement or alternate tires or wheels on the vehicle that prevent the TPMS (tire pressure warning system) from functioning properly.

Specifications\n\nFuel information\n\nYou must only use unleaded gasoline. Select octane rating 87 (Research Octane Number 91) or higher. Use of unleaded gasoline with an octane rating lower than 87 may result in engine knocking. Persistent knocking can lead to engine damage.\n\nAt minimum, the gasoline you use should meet the specifications of ASTM D4814 in the U.S.A..\n\n\u25a0 Gasoline quality\n\nIn very few cases, driveability problems may be caused by the brand of gaso- line you are using. If driveability problems persist, try changing the brand of gasoline. If this does not correct the problem, consult your Toyota dealer. \u25a0 Recommendation of the use of gasoline containing detergent additives\n\nToyota recommends the use of gasoline that contains detergent additives to avoid the build-up of engine deposits.\n\nAll gasoline sold in the U.S.A. contains minimum detergent additives to clean and/or keep clean intake systems, per EPA\u2019s lowest additives concen- tration program.\n\nToyota strongly recommends the use of Top Tier Detergent Gasoline. For more information on Top Tier Detergent Gasoline and a list of marketers, please go to the official website www.toptiergas.com.\n\n489\n\n8\n\nV e h c e s p e c i f i c a\n\ni\n\nl\n\nt i\n\no n s\n\n490\n\n8-1.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c07cd3c4-14fe-457b-96d9-eb6ad49722cc": {"__data__": {"id_": "c07cd3c4-14fe-457b-96d9-eb6ad49722cc", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"year": 2021}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "2f052a6f-ca2c-4d02-a190-afb23ac726e8", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"year": 2021}, "hash": "dcbdece47b1b641c5b6865b3914c32c032a049703ae56daee296cd89577af5e0"}, "2": {"node_id": "dcde5617-a5f4-4f3b-8569-1c43a0417763", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"year": 2021}, "hash": "c53bc26ed37a990f85543579b2ae450e41625769e4a0dfb0915b2ef990e23310"}, "3": {"node_id": "e78a16d7-343e-4343-a0a4-8cec863eeb46", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"year": 2021}, "hash": "fefb44cdc22087ed5a8a3d0513cdec9e0c325a10bf1e35dea7eb830b45dca5cf"}}, "hash": "e189638f82e28acf61e3b7da0b264a345d1b6041b6aaca1a8777d33602eda45a", "text": "Specifications\n\n\u25a0 Recommendation of the use of low emissions gasoline\n\nGasolines containing oxygenates such as ethers and ethanol, as well as reformulated gasolines, are available in some cities. These fuels are typically acceptable for use, providing they meet other fuel requirements. Toyota recommends these fuels, since the formulations allow for reduced vehicle emissions.\n\n\u25a0 Non-recommendation of the use of blended gasoline\n\nUse only gasoline containing up to 15% ethanol. DO NOT use any flex-fuel or gasoline that could contain more than 15% etha- nol, including from any pump labeled E30, E50, E85 (which are only some examples of fuel containing more than 15% ethanol).\n\nDO NOT use gasoline contain- ing more than 15% ethanol.\n\n(30% ethanol)\n\n(50% ethanol)\n\n(85% ethanol)\n\nIf you use gasohol in your vehicle, be sure that it has an octane rating no lower than 87.\n\nToyota does not recommend the use of gasoline containing methanol.\n\n\u25a0 Non-recommendation of the use of gasoline containing MMT\n\nSome gasoline contains an octane enhancing additive called MMT (Methylcy- clopentadienyl Manganese Tricarbonyl). Toyota does not recommend the use of gasoline that contains MMT. If fuel containing MMT is used, your emission control system may be adversely affected. The malfunction indicator lamp on the instrument cluster may come on. If this happens, contact your Toyota dealer for service.\n\n\u25a0 If your engine knocks\n\nConsult your Toyota dealer. \u25cf You may occasionally notice light knocking for a short time while accelerat- ing or driving uphill.

Specifications\n\nUniform Tire Quality Grading\n\nThis information has been prepared in accordance with regulations issued by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration of the U.S. Department of Transportation. It provides the purchasers and/or prospective purchasers of Toyota vehicles with information on uniform tire quality grading.\n\nYour Toyota dealer will help answer any questions you may have as you read this information.\n\n\u25a0 DOT quality grades\n\nAll passenger vehicle tires must conform to Federal Safety Require- ments in addition to these grades. Quality grades can be found where applicable on the tire sidewall between tread shoulder and maximum section width.\n\nFor example: Treadwear 200 Traction AA Temperature A\n\n\u25a0 Treadwear\n\nThe treadwear grade is a comparative rating based on the wear rate of the tire when tested under controlled conditions on a speci- fied government test course.\n\nFor example, a tire graded 150 would wear one and a half (1 - 1/2) times as well on the government course as a tire graded 100. The relative performance of tires depends upon the actual condi- tions of their use. Performance may differ significantly from the norm due to variations in driving habits, service practices and differences in road characteristics and climate.\n\n\u25a0 Traction AA, A, B, C\n\nThe traction grades, from highest to lowest, are AA, A, B and C, and they represent the tire\u2019s ability to stop on wet pavement as measured under controlled conditions on specified government test surfaces of asphalt and concrete.\n\nA tire marked C may have poor traction performance. Warning: The traction grade assigned to this tire is based on braking (straight ahead) traction tests and does not include cornering (turn- ing) traction.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c3ca3682-58a1-426b-84bd-eb9542c9aec0": {"__data__": {"id_": "c3ca3682-58a1-426b-84bd-eb9542c9aec0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"year": 2021}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "2f052a6f-ca2c-4d02-a190-afb23ac726e8", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"year": 2021}, "hash": "dcbdece47b1b641c5b6865b3914c32c032a049703ae56daee296cd89577af5e0"}, "2": {"node_id": "1e6ddc64-210a-4695-a390-fec5676d6c85", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"year": 2021}, "hash": "3bfb88de4f8593015e0812ae941500c562057be81e289ff2eb8c92ddff0e7186"}, "3": {"node_id": "9aa1d66d-6796-40db-b49a-b0ad381869a6", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"year": 2021}, "hash": "179309db47c31005595b60f77460094968e2ebe67e306036e5cf428528f0a321"}}, "hash": "ef2defdc2d3919b98d02f5d5466ec798a54d5e6a5fb136f64301d4d67722dbb2", "text": "497\n\n8\n\nV e h c e s p e c i f i c a\n\ni\n\nl\n\nt i\n\no n s\n\n498\n\n8-1.

Grade C corresponds to a level of performance which all passenger car tires must meet under the Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Stan- dard No. 109. Grades B and A represent higher levels of performance on the labo- ratory test wheel than the minimum required by law. Warning: The temperature grades of a tire assume that it is properly inflated and not overloaded. Excessive speed, underinflation, or excessive loading, either sepa- rately or in combination, can cause heat buildup and possible tire failure.\n\n8-1.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9aa1d66d-6796-40db-b49a-b0ad381869a6": {"__data__": {"id_": "9aa1d66d-6796-40db-b49a-b0ad381869a6", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"year": 2021}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "2f052a6f-ca2c-4d02-a190-afb23ac726e8", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"year": 2021}, "hash": "dcbdece47b1b641c5b6865b3914c32c032a049703ae56daee296cd89577af5e0"}, "2": {"node_id": "c3ca3682-58a1-426b-84bd-eb9542c9aec0", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"year": 2021}, "hash": "ef2defdc2d3919b98d02f5d5466ec798a54d5e6a5fb136f64301d4d67722dbb2"}, "3": {"node_id": "92c17349-91bc-4f34-b668-171673164fd8", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"year": 2021}, "hash": "c913a9ad2e07d3795c6c81052c1d90dd261f8a4c241521597bc8cd2be282ef02"}}, "hash": "179309db47c31005595b60f77460094968e2ebe67e306036e5cf428528f0a321", "text": "8-1.
