Alcohol and certain drugs delay reaction time, impair judgment and reduce coordination, which could lead to an accident that could result in death or serious injury. Defensive driving: Always drive defensively. Anticipate mistakes that other drivers or pedestrians might make and be ready to avoid accidents. Driver distraction: Always give your full attention to driving. Anything that distracts the driver, such as adjusting controls, talking on a cellular phone or reading can result in a collision with resulting death or serious injury to you, your occupants or others.\n\n\u25a0 General precaution regarding children\u2019s safety\n\nNever leave children unattended in the vehicle, and never allow children to have or use the key. Children may be able to start the vehicle or shift the vehicle into neutral. There is also a danger that children may injure themselves by playing with the windows, the moon roof, or other features of the vehicle. In addition, heat build-up or extremely cold temperatures inside the vehicle can be fatal to children.\n\n13\n\n14\n\nReading this manual\n\nWARNING: Explains something that, if not obeyed, could cause death or serious injury to people.\n\nNOTICE: Explains something that, if not obeyed, could cause damage to or a malfunction in the vehicle or its equipment.\n\n1 2 3\n\nIndicates operating or working procedures.

For safe use\n\nWARNING\n\n\u25a0 SRS airbag precautions\n\nObserve the following precautions regarding the SRS airbags. Failure to do so may cause death or serious injury. \u25cf The driver and all passengers in the vehicle must wear their seat belts\n\nproperly. The SRS airbags are supplemental devices to be used with the seat belts. \u25cf The SRS driver airbag deploys with considerable force, and can cause death or serious injury especially if the driver is very close to the airbag. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) advises: Since the risk zone for the driver\u2019s airbag is the first 2 - 3 in. (50 - 75 mm) of inflation, placing yourself 10 in. (250 mm) from your driver airbag pro- vides you with a clear margin of safety. This distance is measured from the center of the steering wheel to your breastbone. If you sit less than 10 in. (250 mm) away now, you can change your driving position in several ways: \u2022 Move your seat to the rear as far as you can while still reaching the ped-\n\nals comfortably.\n\nSlightly recline the back of the seat.\n\nAlthough vehicle designs vary, many drivers can achieve the 10 in. (250 mm) distance, even with the driver seat all the way forward, simply by reclining the back of the seat somewhat. If reclining the back of your seat makes it hard to see the road, raise yourself by using a firm, non- slippery cushion, or raise the seat if your vehicle has that feature.\n\nIf your steering wheel is adjustable, tilt it downward. This points the air- bag toward your chest instead of your head and neck.\n\nThe seat should be adjusted as recommended by NHTSA above, while still maintaining control of the foot pedals, steering wheel, and your view of the instrument panel controls.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a62414f1-8acf-4700-be82-43de7a6e65d0": {"__data__": {"id_": "a62414f1-8acf-4700-be82-43de7a6e65d0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"year": 2022}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "c16f18e6-fdf7-4cc0-9b51-11beba00352b", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"year": 2022}, "hash": "c46e809a06f1a658ccaaf25263fbd5caf1409c0080b4a10ca48634f17a5c1f8e"}, "2": {"node_id": "ddc701da-6d33-4e2e-b58d-aa6dc9cd6c36", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"year": 2022}, "hash": "d2e5880e0c53ee8ae299ec7b3ee4f15486daa422678346fcafba31953c366e3b"}, "3": {"node_id": "a5b6f221-36d8-4f5e-a682-1c6ae272e95b", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"year": 2022}, "hash": "4c8d4537a8062726b4505a47170dfc8cabc5c4f31df254c8e52888712e8df1de"}}, "hash": "0a6e07a7911f97d727c29310608c68af6a5a59d2d534c7ce39411f0bc7f30b9e", "text": "39\n\n1\n\nF o r\n\ns a f e t y\n\na n d\n\ns e c u r i t y\n\n40\n\n1-1.

In this case, the SRS front airbags for the driver may not activate correctly in a collision, resulting in death or serious injury in the event of a collision. Be sure to wear the seat belt with the seat belt extender.\n\nThe SRS front passenger airbag also deploys with considerable force, and can cause death or serious injury especially if the front passenger is very close to the airbag. The front passenger seat should be as far from the air- bag as possible with the seatback adjusted, so the front passenger sits upright.\n\nImproperly seated and/or restrained infants and children can be killed or seriously injured by a deploying airbag. An infant or child who is too small to use a seat belt should be properly secured using a child restraint sys- tem. Toyota strongly recommends that all infants and children be placed in the rear seats of the vehicle and properly restrained. The rear seats are safer for infants and children than the front passenger seat. (\uf0aeP. 56)\n\nWARNING\n\n\u25a0 SRS airbag precautions\n\nDo not sit on the edge of the seat or lean against the dashboard.\n\nDo not allow a child to stand in front of the SRS front passenger airbag unit or sit on the knees of a front passenger. \u25cf Do not allow the front seat occupants to hold items on their knees.\n\nDo not lean against the door, the roof side rail or the front, side and rear pil- lars.\n\nDo not allow anyone to kneel on the passenger seats toward the door or put their head or hands outside the vehicle.\n\n1-1.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a5b6f221-36d8-4f5e-a682-1c6ae272e95b": {"__data__": {"id_": "a5b6f221-36d8-4f5e-a682-1c6ae272e95b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"year": 2022}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "c16f18e6-fdf7-4cc0-9b51-11beba00352b", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"year": 2022}, "hash": "c46e809a06f1a658ccaaf25263fbd5caf1409c0080b4a10ca48634f17a5c1f8e"}, "2": {"node_id": "a62414f1-8acf-4700-be82-43de7a6e65d0", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"year": 2022}, "hash": "0a6e07a7911f97d727c29310608c68af6a5a59d2d534c7ce39411f0bc7f30b9e"}, "3": {"node_id": "9435d140-39ac-4bcb-97ab-dc359b814cce", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"year": 2022}, "hash": "26acdcecd4186aaa6dc468a63a6d6a6599c0b87d9421b81433aefece4e8048c9"}}, "hash": "4c8d4537a8062726b4505a47170dfc8cabc5c4f31df254c8e52888712e8df1de", "text": "1-1.

Holding a child in your arms is not a substitute for a child restraint system. In an accident, the child can be crushed against the windshield, or between you and the vehicle\u2019s interior. \u25cf Toyota strongly urges the use of a proper child restraint system that con- forms to the size of the child, installed on the rear seat. According to acci- dent statistics, the child is safer when properly restrained in the rear seat than in the front seat.\n\nNever install a rear-facing child restraint system on the front passenger seat even if the \u201cAIR BAG OFF\u201d indicator light is illuminated. In the event of an accident, the force of the rapid inflation of the front pas- senger airbag can cause death or serious injury to the child if the rear-fac- ing child restraint system is installed on the front passenger seat.\n\nA forward-facing child restraint system may be installed on the front pas- senger seat only when it is unavoidable. A child restraint system that requires a top tether strap should not be used in the front passenger seat since there is no top tether strap anchor for the front passenger seat. Adjust the seatback as upright as possible and always move the seat as far back as possible even if the \u201cAIR BAG OFF\u201d indicator light is illumi- nated, because the front passenger airbag could inflate with considerable speed and force. Otherwise, the child may be killed or seriously injured. \u25cf Do not use the seat belt extender when installing a child restraint system on the front or rear passenger seat. If installing a child restraint system with the seat belt extender connected to the seat belt, the seat belt will not securely hold the child restraint system, which could cause death or seri- ous injury to the child or other passengers in the event of a sudden stop, sudden swerve or accident.\n\nDo not allow the child to lean his/her head or any part of his/her body against the door or the area of the seat, front and rear pillars or roof side rails from which the SRS side airbags or SRS curtain shield airbags deploy even if the child is seated in the child restraint system.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d481839b-7d6e-4033-9933-13e7ee02de51": {"__data__": {"id_": "d481839b-7d6e-4033-9933-13e7ee02de51", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"year": 2022}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "c16f18e6-fdf7-4cc0-9b51-11beba00352b", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"year": 2022}, "hash": "c46e809a06f1a658ccaaf25263fbd5caf1409c0080b4a10ca48634f17a5c1f8e"}, "2": {"node_id": "3c0f1b0f-ffcb-48f4-81f6-dccb61f5e5eb", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"year": 2022}, "hash": "0081c4220d3e055219d7c7fea2d085267bfb9320a623cea037fad9dac47a0e1b"}, "3": {"node_id": "37ad6d32-9bf2-40cb-b10c-087e5f69eb7f", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"year": 2022}, "hash": "e88f1817e687ec577bd1cae485db54779d433793353513117fa89bfcb9519ecb"}}, "hash": "76e45f34a7e0e71b74d0a157686d3d110e19d2caba7ed1351e7ff3f0a856863c", "text": "It is dangerous if the SRS side airbags and curtain shield airbags inflate, and the impact could cause death or serious injury to the child.\n\nMake sure you have complied with all installation instructions provided by the child restraint manufacturer and that the system is properly secured.

For safe use\n\nWARNING\n\n\u25a0 When children are in the vehicle\n\nDo not allow children to play with the seat belt. If the seat belt becomes twisted around a child\u2019s neck, it may lead to choking or other serious injuries that could result in death. If this occurs and the buckle cannot be unfastened, scissors should be used to cut the belt.\n\n\u25a0 When the child restraint system is not in use\n\nKeep the child restraint system properly secured on the seat even if it is not in use. Do not store the child restraint system unsecured in the pas- senger compartment.\n\nIf it is necessary to detach the child restraint system, remove it from the vehicle or store it securely in the trunk.

For safe use\n\nExhaust gas precautions\n\nHarmful substance to the human body is included in exhaust gases if inhaled.\n\nWARNING\n\nExhaust gases include harmful carbon monoxide (CO), which is colorless and odorless. Observe the following precautions. Failure to do so may cause exhaust gases enter the vehicle and may lead to an accident caused by light-headedness, or may lead to death or a serious health hazard. \u25a0 Important points while driving\n\nKeep the trunk lid closed. \u25cf If you smell exhaust gases in the vehicle even when the trunk lid is closed, open the windows and have the vehicle inspected at your Toyota dealer as soon as possible.\n\n\u25a0 When parking\n\nIf the vehicle is in a poorly ventilated area or a closed area, such as a garage, stop the engine.\n\nDo not leave the vehicle with the engine on for a long time.\n\nIf such a situation cannot be avoided, park the vehicle in an open space and ensure that exhaust fumes do not enter the vehicle interior.\n\nDo not leave the engine running in an area with snow build-up, or where it is snowing. If snowbanks build up around the vehicle while the engine is running, exhaust gases may collect and enter the vehicle.\n\n\u25a0 Exhaust pipe\n\nThe exhaust system needs to be checked periodically. If there is a hole or crack caused by corrosion, damage to a joint or abnormal exhaust noise, be sure to have the vehicle inspected and repaired by your Toyota dealer.\n\n1-2.

At extremely low temperatures, the information display monitor may respond slowly, and display changes may be delayed. For example, there is a lag between the driver\u2019s shifting and the new gear number appearing on the display. This lag could cause the driver to down- shift again, causing rapid and excessive engine braking and possibly an accident resulting in death or injury.\n\n\u25a0 Cautions during setting up the display\n\nAs the engine needs to be running during setting up the display, ensure that the vehicle is parked in a place with adequate ventilation.

Depressing the brake pedal using your left foot may delay response in an emergency, result- ing in an accident.\n\nDo not drive the vehicle over or stop the vehicle near flammable materials. The exhaust system and exhaust gases can be extremely hot. These hot parts may cause a fire if there is any flammable material nearby.\n\nDuring normal driving, do not turn off the engine. Turning the engine off while driving will not cause loss of steering or braking control, but the power assist to these systems will be lost. This will make it more difficult to steer and brake, so you should pull over and stop the vehicle as soon as it is safe to do so. However, in the event of an emergency, such as if it becomes impossible to stop the vehicle in the normal way: \uf0aeP. 445\n\nUse engine braking (downshift) to maintain a safe speed when driving down a steep hill. Using the brakes continuously may cause the brakes to overheat and lose effectiveness. (\uf0aeP. 192)\n\nDo not adjust the display, the positions of the steering wheel, the seat, or the inside or outside rear view mirrors while driving. Doing so may result in a loss of vehicle control.\n\nAlways check that all passengers\u2019 arms, heads or other parts of their body are not outside the vehicle.\n\nAWD models: Do not drive the vehicle off-road.\n\nThis is not an AWD vehicle designed for off-road driving.

Before driving\n\nWARNING\n\nObserve the following precautions. Failure to do so may result in death or serious injury.\n\nDo not leave a door or window open if the curved glass is coated with a metallized film such as a silver-colored one. Reflected sunlight may cause the glass to act as a lens, causing a fire.\n\n\u25a0 When the vehicle is parked\n\nAlways apply the parking brake, shift the shift lever to P, stop the engine and lock the vehicle. Do not leave the vehicle unattended while the engine is running. If the vehicle is parked with the shift lever in P but the parking brake is not set, the vehicle may start to move, possibly leading to an accident.\n\nDo not touch the exhaust pipes while the engine is running or immediately\n\nafter turning the engine off. Doing so may cause burns. \u25a0 When taking a nap in the vehicle\n\nAlways turn the engine off. Otherwise, if you accidentally move the shift lever or depress the accelerator pedal, this could cause an accident or fire due to engine overheating. Additionally, if the vehicle is parked in a poorly ventilated area, exhaust gases may collect and enter the vehicle, leading to death or a serious health hazard.\n\n\u25a0 When braking\n\nWhen the brakes are wet, drive more cautiously.\n\nBraking distance increases when the brakes are wet, and this may cause one side of the vehicle to brake differently than the other side. Also, the parking brake may not securely hold the vehicle.\n\nIf the brake booster device does not operate, do not follow other vehicles closely and avoid hills or sharp turns that require braking. In this case, braking is still possible, but the brake pedal should be depressed more firmly than usual. Also, the braking distance will increase.

(1400 \uf02d 750 (5\uf020\uf0b4\uf020150) = 650 lbs.)\n\n(5) Determine the combined weight of luggage and cargo being loaded on the vehicle. That weight may not safely exceed the available cargo and luggage load capacity calculated in Step 4.\n\n(6) If your vehicle will be towing a trailer, load from your trailer will be transferred to your vehicle.

Failure to do so may cause an accident resulting in death or serious injury. \u25cf Assisting the driver to measure following distance\n\nThe dynamic radar cruise control with full-speed range is only intended to help the driver in determining the following distance between the driver\u2019s own vehicle and a designated vehicle traveling ahead. It is not a mecha- nism that allows careless or inattentive driving, and it is not a system that can assist the driver in low-visibility conditions. It is still necessary for driver to pay close attention to the vehicle\u2019s sur- roundings.\n\nAssisting the driver to judge proper following distance\n\nThe dynamic radar cruise control with full-speed range determines whether the following distance between the driver\u2019s own vehicle and a designated vehicle traveling ahead is within a set range. It is not capable of making any other type of judgement. Therefore, it is absolutely neces- sary for the driver to remain vigilant and to determine whether or not there is a possibility of danger in any given situation.\n\nAssisting the driver to operate the vehicle\n\nThe dynamic radar cruise control with full-speed range does not include functions which will prevent or avoid collisions with vehicles ahead of your vehicle.

Example of deceleration cruising and follow-up cruising When a preceding vehicle driving slower than the set speed appears\n\nWhen a vehicle is detected running ahead of you, the system automatically decelerates your vehicle. When a greater reduction in vehicle speed is necessary, the system applies the brakes (the stop lights will come on at this time).

Failure to do so may be dangerous because it may cause the vehi- cle to move unexpectedly, possibly leading to an accident.\n\nIf the vehicle is parked without setting the parking brake, confirm that the shift lever cannot be moved out of P*.\n\n: The shift lever will be locked if it is attempted to be shifted from P to any other position without depressing the brake pedal. If the shift lever can be shifted from P, there may be a problem with the shift lock system.

Always check local regulations before installing chains.\n\n\u25a0 Tire chain installation\n\nObserve the following precautions when installing and removing chains: \u25cf Install and remove tire chains in a safe location. \u25cf Install tire chains on the front tires. Do not install tire chains on the rear tires. \u25cf Install tire chains on front tires as tightly as possible. Retighten chains after\n\ndriving 1/4 \uf0be 1/2 mile (0.5 \uf0be 1.0 km).\n\nInstall tire chains following the instructions provided with the tire chains.\n\nWARNING\n\n\u25a0 Driving with snow tires\n\nObserve the following precautions to reduce the risk of accidents. Failure to do so may result in a loss of vehicle control and cause death or serious injury. \u25cf Use tires of the size specified. \u25cf Maintain the recommended level of air pressure. \u25cf Do not drive in excess of 75 mph (120 km/h), regardless of the type of\n\nsnow tires being used.\n\nUse snow tires on all, not just some wheels.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7b641f0b-7663-4d31-9c1f-8262cead55ac": {"__data__": {"id_": "7b641f0b-7663-4d31-9c1f-8262cead55ac", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"year": 2022}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "c16f18e6-fdf7-4cc0-9b51-11beba00352b", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"year": 2022}, "hash": "c46e809a06f1a658ccaaf25263fbd5caf1409c0080b4a10ca48634f17a5c1f8e"}, "2": {"node_id": "16294528-a82d-4846-8fe1-d8b0f05ce341", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"year": 2022}, "hash": "70045a27f2f2ad8c718774aca65dba5f9af9f590684cd1ac61441d27829a3408"}, "3": {"node_id": "a5026f1f-e70f-43cf-b515-fca1d62b35d7", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"year": 2022}, "hash": "e20c56670bc1b2a166619539020e7f44f89914e0ae00ef48e12b5f8b35260cd8"}}, "hash": "449610a5037b9703b738f11a8bac00ae3fae9fca9984f7ba3a4221299e41c691", "text": "Use snow tires on all, not just some wheels.\n\n\u25a0 Driving with tire chains (vehicles with 17-inch tires)\n\nObserve the following precautions to reduce the risk of accidents.

If water does not bead on a clean surface, apply wax when the vehicle body is cool.\n\n\u25a0 Automatic car washes\n\nFold the mirrors before washing the vehicle. Start washing from the front of the vehicle. Make sure to extend the mirrors before driving.\n\nBrushes used in automatic car washes may scratch the vehicle surface, parts (wheel, etc.) and harm your vehicle's paint.\n\nVehicles with a rear spoiler: In certain automatic car washes, the rear spoiler may interfere with machine operation. This may prevent the vehicle from being cleaned properly or result in damage to the rear spoiler.\n\n\u25a0 High pressure car washes\n\nAs water may enter the cabin, do not bring the nozzle tip near the gaps around the doors or perimeter of the windows, or spray these areas continu- ously.\n\n\u25a0 When using a car wash\n\nIf the door handle becomes wet while the electronic key is within the effective range, the door may lock and unlock repeatedly. In that case, follow the fol- lowing correction procedures to wash the vehicle: \u25cf Place the key in a position 6 ft. (2 m) or more separate from the vehicle while the vehicle is being washed.

Do-it-yourself maintenance\n\n\u25a0 When to replace your vehicle\u2019s tires\n\nTires should be replaced if: \u25cf The treadwear indicators are showing on a tire. \u25cf You have tire damage such as cuts, splits, cracks deep enough to\n\nexpose the fabric, and bulges indicating internal damage\n\nA tire goes flat repeatedly or cannot be properly repaired due to the size or location of a cut or other damage\n\nIf you are not sure, consult with your Toyota dealer.\n\n\u25a0 Replacing tires and wheels\n\nIf the ID codes of the tire pressure warning valve and transmitters are not registered, the tire pressure warning system will not work properly. In this case, after driving for about 20 minutes, the tire pressure warning light will blink for approximately 1 minute and then illuminate to indicate a system malfunction.\n\n\u25a0 Tire life\n\nAny tire over 6 years old must be checked by a qualified technician even if it has seldom or never been used or damage is not obvious.\n\n\u25a0 Routine tire inflation pressure checks\n\nThe tire pressure warning system does not replace routine tire inflation pressure checks. Make sure to check tire inflation pressure as part of your routine of daily vehicle checks.\n\n\u25a0 Low profile tires (vehicles with 18 or 19-inch wheels)\n\nGenerally, low profile tires will wear more rapidly and tire grip perfor- mance will be reduced on snowy and/or icy roads when compared to standard tires.

Do-it-yourself maintenance\n\n\u25a0 Tire types\n\nSummer tires\n\nSummer tires are high-speed performance tires best suited to highway driving under dry conditions. Since summer tires do not have the same traction performance as snow tires, summer tires are inadequate for driving on snow-covered or icy roads. For driving on snow-covered roads or icy roads, the use of snow tires is recommended. When install- ing snow tires, be sure to replace all four tires.\n\nAll season tires\n\nAll season tires are designed to provide better traction in snow and to be adequate for driving in most winter conditions as well as for use year-round. All season tires, however, do not have adequate traction performance compared with snow tires in heavy or loose snow. Also, all season tires fall short in acceleration and handling performance com- pared with summer tires in highway driving.\n\nSnow tires\n\nFor driving on snow-covered roads or icy roads, we recommend using snow tires. If you need snow tires, select tires of the same size, con- struction and load capacity as the originally installed tires. Since your vehicle has radial tires as original equipment, make sure your snow tires also have radial construction. Do not install studded tires without first checking local regulations for possible restrictions. Snow tires should be installed on all wheels.

Doing so may result in an accident, causing death or seri- ous injury.\n\n\u25a0 When installing the wheel nuts\n\nBe sure to install the wheel nuts with the tapered ends facing inward. (\uf0aeP. 478) Installing the nuts with the tapered ends facing outward can cause the wheel to break and eventually cause the wheel to come off while driving, which could lead to an accident resulting in death or seri- ous injury.\n\nNever use oil or grease on the wheel bolts or wheel nuts.\n\nOil and grease may cause the wheel nuts to be excessively tightened, leading to bolt or disc wheel damage. In addition, the oil or grease can cause the wheel nuts to loosen and the wheel may fall off, causing an accident and resulting in death or serious injury. Remove any oil or grease from the wheel bolts or wheel nuts.\n\nNOTICE\n\n\u25a0 Replacing tire pressure warning valve and transmitters\n\nBecause tire repair or replacement may affect the tire pressure warn- ing valve and transmitters, make sure to have tires serviced by your Toyota dealer or other qualified service shop. In addition, make sure to purchase your tire pressure warning valve and transmitters at your Toyota dealer.\n\nEnsure that only genuine Toyota wheels are used on your vehicle.

Driving on a significantly under- inflated tire causes the tire to overheat and can lead to tire failure. Under-inflation also reduces fuel efficiency and tire tread life, and may affect the vehicle\u2019s handling and stopping ability. Please note that the TPMS (tire pressure warning system) is not a sub- stitute for proper tire maintenance, and it is the driver\u2019s responsibility to maintain correct tire pressure, even if under-inflation has not reached the level to trigger illumination of the TPMS low tire pressure telltale (tire pressure warning light). Your vehicle has also been equipped with a TPMS (tire pressure warn- ing system) malfunction indicator to indicate when the system is not operating properly. The TPMS (tire pressure warning system) malfunc- tion indicator is combined with the low tire pressure telltale (tire pressure warning light). When the system detects a malfunction, the telltale will flash for approximately one minute and then remain continuously illumi- nated. This sequence will continue upon subsequent vehicle start-ups as long as the malfunction exists. When the malfunction indicator is illu- minated, the system may not be able to detect or signal low tire pres- sure as intended. TPMS (tire pressure warning system) malfunctions may occur for a vari- ety of reasons, including the installation of replacement or alternate tires or wheels on the vehicle that prevent the TPMS (tire pressure warning system) from functioning properly. Always check the TPMS (tire pres- sure warning system) malfunction telltale after replacing one or more tires or wheels on your vehicle to ensure that the replacement or alter- nate tires and wheels allow the TPMS (tire pressure warning system) to continue to function properly.\n\n463\n\n7\n\nW h e n\n\nt r o u b e a r i s e s\n\nl\n\n464\n\n7-2.
